        <h2>http://localhost:3002/send/</h2>
        <p>The action attribute with the URL <code>http://localhost:3002/send/</code> does not work here on GitHub Pages.
            This is because GitHub Pages only supports a few fixed files and no local server environment like ‘localhost’. The URL
            refers to a server that exists locally and can’t be reachable through the GitHub Pages framework.</p>

        <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
        <p>The action attribute with the URL <code>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</code> works on GitHub
            Pages. This is so because the homepage leads to an outside hosted Heroku server which in turns is capable of handling.
            HTTP POST requests. What is more, GitHub Pages may interact with such distant services, thus making this action possible.
